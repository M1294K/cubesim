🧩 Cube Duel — 1v1 Real-Time Rubik’s Cube Battle

A competitive speed-cubing web app powered by AnimCubeJS   https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS

🚀 Overview

Cube Duel is an interactive 1v1 Rubik’s Cube battle platform built using the open-source library AnimCubeJS
.
The goal of this project is to let two players compete in real time: both receive the same scramble, solve a virtual cube independently, and the faster solver wins.

This project combines speed-cubing, real-time interaction, and web-based visualization to create a fun and competitive experience.
